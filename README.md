# Analyzing and Comparing Reinforcement Learning Approaches: Study and Benchmarking

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive comparison of various reinforcement learning (RL) techniques using PyTorch. The goal is to benchmark the performance of different RL algorithms and replay buffer strategies in OpenAI Gym environments. 

## Features
- **Algorithms Implemented**: 
  - Q-Learning
  - Deep Q-Learning
  - Double Deep Q-Learning
  - Dueling Q-Learning
- **Replay Buffers**:
  - Regular Replay Buffer
  - Priority Replay Buffer
- **Environments**:
  - CartPole
  - LunarLander
  - Acrobot

## Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook and select your desired parameters**:
2. Open the notebook and execute the last cell to train the agents and generate performance graphs.

## Results
The results include graphs comparing the scores of each RL technique across different environments. These graphs provide insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of each algorithm.
